                <p>
                    1. IT is characterised by above average systems, engineering and development capabilities, complemented by high agility.
                </p>

                <p>
                    2. Kotoâ€™s access to highly skilled resources in this way ensures we are above market standard in terms of our technology.
                </p>

                <p>
                    3. Given our strategy to leverage skills and experience from Monobank, our focus is on oversight and governance arrangements, including ensuring adequate documentation is in place to demonstrate the ways in which these teams work.

                <h3>HEADLINE: Credit Risk at Koto is rated as better than the market, particularly in onboarding and credit decisioning.</h3>
                <p>
                    1. Credit Risk talent is a particular strength, and the maturity of capabilities is better than one would expect at launch. This will continue to evolve and remain better than the market as we book more customers and have more data available in more volume.
                </p>

                <p>
                    2. A gap in UK-based oversight and detailed compliance assurance can be closed by hiring in-country experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    3. Maturity and expertise is in line with the overall strategy to focus on better-than-industry lending, supported by industry-standard collections.

                <p>
                    1. The Koto model relies on the outsourcing of key Operations activity, which requires us to have superior levels of oversight and control, which is in progress and already at market standard.
                </p>

                <p>
                    2. A key component of our business is the provision of superior customer service, so despite exceeding the market standard we want to focus on this even further, primarily ensuring that this relatively new function continues to operate at a high standard.
                </p>

                <p>
                    3. Collections has not yet been a focus; given the value and volume of lending this has been appropriate to date, but will require some development to meet our targeted level.

                <p>
                    1. The Koto model of outsourcing requires us to have superior central risk management,
                    which would meet the regulatory expectation to develop risk management appropriate to the business model.
                </p>

                <p>
                    2. Risk resourcing in key areas such as Financial Crime and Compliance are in place,
                    and work has so far focussed on the areas of highest risk.
                </p>

                <p>
                    3. Extending this activity across the enterprise will bring it to the targeted level;
                    the models are in place and this is already work in progress.
                </p>

                <p>
                    4. Although there is some work to do in this area, the standard already being achieved
                    is as would be expected for a firm our size and age.

                    particularly as to achieve scale quickly, multiple channels will need to be established.
                </p>

                <p>
                    3. To ensure effective utilisation of the Monobank resources,
                    in-country resource is needed with UK market expertise.
